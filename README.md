This webpage is still under development so you may face issues with responsive design.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the packages:

```
npm install
```

The run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Notes

This is strictly the front-end of a mvc application. For this reason it is filled with temporary dummy data instead of data from a DB.

#

When promoted to login, just hit the button without typing anything into the username or password fields. Being the view, it doesn't have the ability to connect with the back-end and authenticate users.

#

Updating user data will temporarily update it until the page is refreshed. Normally, you would retrieve the data from the DB and update it when the user updates it.
